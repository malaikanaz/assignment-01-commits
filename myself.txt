Hi!
Iam Malaika Naz, currently studying Intermediate ICS Part-1.
I am excited to share that I have recently developed a keen interest in generative AI, which is why Ienrolled in this course.
As a begineer in the field, I am still learning the basics and dont have extensive knowledge about AI just yet.
However I am eager to learn and grow in this area.
I hope to benefit from your support and cooperation as we explore this fascinating subject together.
Looking forward to working with all of you!
this is all about my introduction.
