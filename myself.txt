hi!
i am malaika, currently studying intermediate ICS Part-1.
i am excited to share that i have recently developed a keen interest in generative ai, which is why i enrolled in this course.
as a begineer in the field, i am still learning the basics and dont have extensive knowledge about ai just yet.
however i am eager to learn and grow in this area.
i hope to benefit from your support and cooperation as we explore this fascinating subject together.
looking forward to working with all of you.
this is all about my introduction.
